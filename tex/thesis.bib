abstract="The structural information of social network data plays an important role in many fields of research. Therefore, privacy-preserving social network publication methods should preserve more structural information, such as the higher-order organizational structure of complex networks (graphlets/motifs). Therefore, how to preserve the graphlet structure information in a social network as much as possible becomes a key problem in social network privacy protection. In this paper, to address the problem of excessive loss of graphlet structural information in the privacy process of published social network data, we proposed a technique of hierarchical k-anonymity for graphlet structural perception. The method considers the degree of social network nodes according to the characteristics of the power-law distribution. The nodes are divided according to the degrees, and the method analyzes the graphlet structural features of the graph in the privacy process and adjusts the privacy-processing strategies of the edges according to the graphlet structural features. This is done, in order to meet the privacy requirement while protecting the graphical structural information in the social network and, improving the utility of the data. This paper uses two real public data sets, WebKB and Cora, and conducted experiments and evaluations. Finally, the experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can concurrently provide the same privacy protection intensity, better maintain the social network's structural information and improve the data's utility.",
